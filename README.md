# Starred repos

## Open topics

- usability of the date picker is not ideal as defaulting from/to to today is not good, normally in this kind of search you want to search in a bit of a longer timeframe, what would be the ideal default setting? 6 months?
- pagination
- use loading state for a spinner
- decide on the best date format
- encode the query in the fetch call
- proper responsiveness (mobile view has some points to be adjusted)
- language picker from static list? is there no where we can get a list of programming languages from?
- min star input is not well designed, think about alternatives
- form validations (e.g at least one language selected? date from/to proper selection, min/max star values?)
- unit tests & integration tests
